# SCHEMA.md — the data contract

This file is the library's real API: the SQLite schema, its semantics, and
its numbered invariants. Code in any language that honors this file is a
conforming implementation. Changes here are contract changes: they bump
`meta.schema_version` and ship with a migration.

Two files:

- **`memory.db`** — the record. Source of truth, backed up, treated as
  precious.
- **`index.db`** — the sidecar. FTS + vectors, derived entirely from
  `memory.db`. **Deleting it is always safe** (I13); it rebuilds from source.

Conventions: timestamps are ISO-8601 UTC with milliseconds
(`2026-07-05T20:14:03.123Z`), stored as TEXT. IDs are lowercase ULIDs
(26 chars, Crockford base32) — time-prefixed, so lexical order is creation
order. JSON columns hold canonical JSON objects, never arrays at the top
level, `{}` when empty.

### Version 2 — identity resolution (docs/ENTITIES.md)

```sql
-- Names a node also answers to. One alias may point at MANY nodes (two
-- different Anas): lookups return candidates, never a winner.
CREATE TABLE aliases (
  alias   TEXT NOT NULL,   -- normalized (lowercase, collapsed whitespace)
  node_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES nodes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  source  TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (source IN ('owner','merge')),
  created TEXT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (alias, node_id)
) STRICT;
CREATE INDEX idx_aliases_node ON aliases(node_id);

-- Open identity questions (Phase B writes these): unordered pair, a < b.
CREATE TABLE identity_pending (
  a        TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES nodes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  b        TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES nodes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  evidence TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (evidence IN ('title_match','token_subset','alias_match')),
  created  TEXT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (a, b)
) STRICT;

-- (v3) What a node used to say (TEMPORAL.md): append-only PRE-mutation
-- snapshots, actor-attributed. Content-bearing BY DESIGN — the complement
-- to the content-free audit log, with the opposite fate under forget (I16).
CREATE TABLE memory_history (
  node_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES nodes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  seq     INTEGER NOT NULL,
  title   TEXT NOT NULL,
  body    TEXT NOT NULL,
  props   TEXT NOT NULL,
  when_at TEXT,                       -- (v4) the pre-change scheduled moment
  actor   TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (actor IN ('owner','agent','system')),
  action  TEXT NOT NULL,
  origin  TEXT NOT NULL,
  at      TEXT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (node_id, seq)
) STRICT;
```

Aliases are content: they join the FTS `extra` column (an alias hit
surfaces the node in recall) and the forget cascade deletes them (I6).

## index.db (disposable)

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE nodes_fts USING fts5(
  id UNINDEXED, kind UNINDEXED, title, content, extra
);
CREATE TABLE vectors (
  id    TEXT NOT NULL,              -- node id
  model TEXT NOT NULL,              -- host-declared vector-space identity
  dim   INTEGER NOT NULL,
  vec   BLOB NOT NULL,              -- little-endian float32, length = dim*4
  PRIMARY KEY (id, model)
) STRICT;
```

## System edge types

| type | source → target | written by | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `links` | any → any | host | generic association (default) |
| `on_day` | node → day node | library | episodic anchor at creation |
| `supersedes` | new → old | library (Decide) | validity chain; old is archived |
| `merged_into` | duplicate → survivor | library | entity-resolution outcome |
| `no_match` | a ↔ b | library (Decide) | owner ruled distinct — never re-propose (I9) |
| `derived_from` | artifact → source | library (recordDerivation) | lineage; cascade root |

Day anchors are keyed by the **UTC calendar day** (I11 — the library is
UTC-only). A host whose owner lives east of UTC should know a late-night
capture files under the UTC day, which may be "yesterday" locally; hosts
wanting owner-local day semantics register and link their own day-like
nodes.

## Status semantics

| status | meaning | reachable from | leaves to |
|---|---|---|---|
| proposed | agent-authored, awaiting owner | (birth) | active, rejected |
| active | part of memory | proposed, archived, quarantined | archived, quarantined, forgotten |
| archived | soft-retired; recallable only by direct query | active | active, forgotten |
| rejected | owner said no; terminal | proposed | — |
| quarantined | actively suppressed everywhere; ask-twice; optional `review_at` | active | active, forgotten |
| forgotten | content destroyed (tombstone); terminal | active, archived, quarantined, merged | — |
| merged | duplicate folded into a survivor; content-preserving husk | active | forgotten |

## Invariants (conformance fixtures reference these by number)

- **I1 — Consent boundary.** A node whose type has `born_status='proposed'`
  enters as `proposed` when `author`/agent-authored, and only an owner
  decision moves it to `active`/`rejected`. Owner-authored nodes are born
  `active`.
- **I2 — Recall filter.** Ambient recall (`recall`, `search`) returns only
  `status='active' AND surfacing='always'` nodes. `surfacing='ask'` nodes
  are returned only when the query names them — an explicit term hit on
  the title, or on the resolution surfaces (`resolveRef`) an
  exact-normalized match of the title or an alias (an alias IS a name) —
  never via broad matching. `surfacing='never'` nodes are reachable only
  by `getNode(id)`.
- **I3 — Traversal filter.** Graph reads (`neighborhood`) return active
  nodes only, exclude `surfacing='never'` neighbors (I2 composes with
  traversal — never means never), and exclude `day` anchors (plumbing,
  the same rule as ambient recall). `ask` neighbors are returned:
  traversal is an owner-facing read of a named subject, not ambient
  matching.
- **I4 — Write-time gate.** `propose` MUST route: normalized-title equality
  vs a pending proposal → merge into it (`merged_pending`); vs an active
  node of the same type → no write at all (`exists_active`); else create
  (`created`). Normalization: lowercase, collapse whitespace.
- **I5 — Adjudication is compound and ordered.** `approve_superseding`
  performs: activate new → archive old → write `supersedes` edge → audit.
  A mid-sequence failure stops and surfaces; no silent rollback of audited
  steps.
- **I6 — Tombstone semantics.** `forget` sets `status='forgotten'`,
  `title=''`, `body=''`, `props='{}'`, `origin=''`, `author=''`, and (v4)
  `when_at=NULL` — a scheduled moment is content, and a tombstone keeps no
  appointment; clears `pending_edits`, (v2) the node's `aliases` and its
  open `identity_pending` questions, and (v3) its `memory_history` rows;
  deletes the node's edges; scrubs it from `nodes_fts` and `vectors`;
  marks `derivations` rows with it as `source` stale; lists merged husks
  chained into it as `husk:<id>` in the report's `needsOwner` (computed
  before the edges drop). The row, `type`, and timestamps survive.
- **I7 — Content-free forget audit.** Audit entries for forget-class actions
  carry ids and counts only. No audit row anywhere carries node title/body
  text.
- **I8 — Terminality.** `rejected` and `forgotten` have no outgoing
  transitions. `merged` is terminal for the FSM and for identity verdicts,
  with one deliberate exception: a husk still holds content, so `forget`
  may destroy it (ENTITIES.md amendment).
- **I9 — No re-litigation.** After a `no_match` edge exists between two
  nodes (either direction): (a) no candidate rule ever re-inserts the pair
  into `identity_pending`, and (b) `decideIdentity(..., "same")` on the
  pair is refused. Answered means answered — the Apple Photos lesson.
- **I10 — Provenance at birth.** Every insert into `nodes` sets `origin`
  (host-supplied; `''` only for owner-manual creations). `author` is set
  whenever content carries a third party's words.
- **I11 — Timestamps and IDs.** All times UTC ISO-8601 with ms; all ids
  lowercase ULID, monotonic within a millisecond per process — under I14's
  single writer, lexical id order IS creation order. `updated >= created`
  always.
- **I12 — Audit coverage.** Every mutation of `nodes`, `edges`,
  `pending_edits`, and every decision writes exactly one audit row
  (compound decisions: one per step plus one summary). (v3)
  `memory_history` snapshots ride inside mutations that already audit —
  they add no audit rows of their own; the history row is the record.
- **I13 — Disposable index.** Deleting `index.db` loses no information;
  `rebuildIndex()` reconstructs it from `memory.db` exactly (FTS rows for
  active nodes only; vectors are re-suppliable by the host).
- **I14 — Single writer.** One `Store` instance owns writes to a given
  `memory.db`. WAL mode permits concurrent external readers (e.g., any
  external tool mounting the file read-only).
- **I15 — Validity is declared, never inferred.** (v3) `valid_from` /
  `valid_until` are set only from explicit arguments to `link`/`closeEdge`
  (strict ISO-8601 UTC; date-only = midnight UTC; `until > from`). The
  library never derives a validity date from content, context, or clock
  heuristics. System edge types (`on_day`, `supersedes`, `merged_into`,
  `no_match`, `derived_from`) carry NULL validity always, and `closeEdge`
  refuses them — closing a `no_match` edge would reopen I9 through the
  side door. Edge-carrying reads (`neighborhood`, `entityContext`) default
  to the currently-valid world; `asOf` time-travels.
- **I16 — History dies with the tombstone.** (v3) `memory_history` rows
  are content: `forget(id)` removes every row for the node in the cascade
  transaction. Audit rows, being content-free, survive. History is
  append-only otherwise — no other verb may delete it. Snapshots are
  taken at exactly three owner-authority moments: `updateNode`,
  `approve_edited`, and parked-edit application (TEMPORAL.md).
- **I17 — Scheduled time is declared, never inferred.** (v4) `when_at` is
  set only from explicit arguments (`createNode`/`propose`/`updateNode`/
  verdict fields — the empty-string verdict field clears; `null` clears
  via updateNode), strict ISO-8601 UTC via the shared rule. The library
  never derives, shifts, or clears it on its own. `agenda(from, to)`
  returns only `status='active' AND surfacing='always'` nodes in the
  half-open window (I2: an agenda pull names nothing); the doctor's
  `dueCandidates` lens excludes `never`-surfaced nodes (the F8 rule).
  History snapshots carry the pre-change `when_at` (I16 unchanged).

## Backup and restore (the file's own survival)

- **The one sanctioned backup is `backup(toPath)`** — `VACUUM INTO` under
  the hood: it reads a consistent snapshot (including writes still in the
  WAL) with only a read lock, never blocks the writer, and produces a
  compacted, forensically clean copy. The target must not exist — backups
  never overwrite.
- **NEVER raw-copy `memory.db` while a store is open.** WAL mode keeps
  recent writes in `memory.db-wal`; copying the main file alone silently
  loses them. A raw copy is safe only after `close()`.
- **Restore** = place the backup file as `memory.db` in a fresh directory,
  open, `rebuildIndex()`. `index.db` is never backed up — it is disposable
  by contract (I13).
- **Verify backups by opening them** — an untested backup is a hope, not a
  backup. `doctor().integrityOk` runs `PRAGMA integrity_check` on the live
  record; run it on a restored copy too.
- **Files from the future refuse to open.** A `memory.db` whose
  `schema_version` exceeds what the build knows throws on open — upgrade
  the library, never downgrade the file. (Older files upgrade in place,
  in order, as always.)

## Deliberate schema choices

- Lowercase ULIDs for every id; strict ISO-8601 UTC timestamps with
  milliseconds, everywhere.
- `importance`, `surfacing`, provenance are real columns, not `props` keys —
  they carry invariants; JSON is for host-defined data only.
- Pending edits are a table, not a `props` envelope — the queue is queryable.
- `STRICT` tables throughout.
